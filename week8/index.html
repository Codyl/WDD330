    <h1>Ajax and advanced function logic</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Ajax</h2>
        <summary>
            The advantage of using ajax(asynchronous Javascript and JSON) is that the page can be updated without
            the browser having to reload. To do this Javascript requests a JSON response object from a server. You
            can use it to request from a site that uses cross orgin resource sharing using an API. In other words you cant just
            request from any server and expect it to work.
        </summary>
        <note>You can use XMLHttpRequest but fetch is the shorter way to do this and uses promises.</note>
        <blockquote><pre><code>
            fetch(url)
            .then( response => response.json() );
            .then( data => console.log(Object.entries(data)) )
            .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
        </code></pre></blockquote>
        <h3>Requests</h3>
        <note>Requests are made to a url to access specific data like weather.</note>
        <div>Requests have the following properties:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>url</li>
            <li>method</li>
            <li>headers</li>
            <li>mode</li>
            <li>cache</li>
            <li>credentials</li>
            <li>redirect</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Responses</h3>
        <note>.json() converts JSON data from the server/API into a Javascript object. We can then manipulate the data in the object.</note>
        <div>Responses have the following properties:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>response.ok</li>
            <li>response.status</li>
            <li>response.statusText</li>
            <li>response.type</li>
            <li>response.url</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Advanced function logic</h2>
        <h3>Recursion</h3>
        <p>
            Functions that call itself again and again until a condition is met. 
            Can be visualized with a tree diagram to see each time the function is called.
            A common example is factorial.
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre><code>
            function factorial(n) {
                if (n === 0) {
                return 1;
                } else {
                return n * factorial(n - 1);
                }
            } 
        </code></pre></blockquote>
        <h3>Callbacks</h3>
        <p>
            Callback are used to let code run asynchronously (non-blocking) despite the fact
            that Javascript is single threaded. We can ensure things that take
            a long time are not keeping the rest of the program from continuing to run. They
            are functions passed to other functions and invoked from inside where they were passed.
            Callbacks always wait for the current execution stack to complete before itâ€™s invoked.
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre><code>
            function wait(message, callback, seconds){
                setTimeout(callback,seconds * 1000);
                console.log(message);
            }
            function selfDestruct(){
                console.log('BOOOOM!');
            }
            wait('This tape will self-destruct in five seconds ... ',
            selfDestruct, 5);
        </code></pre></blockquote>
        <h3>Promises</h3>
        <p>Promises do the same thing as callbacks but simplify the process and avoid
            too many nested callbacks. Promises take the functions resolve and reject as arguments.
            Promises have a then method for fulfillment and/or rejection cases and a catch method for 
            just handling the rejection case.
        </p>
        <h3>Closures</h3>
        <p>Functions that allow you to access variables outside their normal scope.
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre><code>
            function closure() {
                const a = 1.8;
                const b = 32;
                return c => c * a + b;
            }  
        </code></pre></blockquote>
        <note>Generators are functions that produce iterators by using a yield (value
            bring returned is remembered by the yield)</note>
        <h3>Functional programming</h3>
        <summary>The big idea with functional programming is using pure functions. pure
            functions can be used with other types of programming as well to avoid errors.
        </summary>
        <div>Pure functions follow these rules:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Return value only depend on parameters.</li>
            <li>Don't not alter values from outside the functions.</li>
            <li>Will always return the same result.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Currying</h3>
        <summary>
            Curried functions take a function as a parameter and/or return a function.
            By returning a function you can store values.
        </summary>
        <blockquote><pre><code>
            function multiplier(x,y) { //Stores x for use in calcTax function if y is undefined
                if (y === undefined) {
                return function(z) {
                return x * z;
                }
                } else {
                return x * y;
                }
            }                
            calcTax = multiplier(0.22);//0.22 is x. No y param is given here 
            << function (z){
            return x * z;
            }
            calcTax(400);// 400 is passed for the value of z. it uses the anon returned function in multiplier to get x.
        </code></pre></blockquote>
