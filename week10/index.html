    <h1>Form validation in legacy browsers</h1>
    <p>Forms must be validated to protect your database, prevent errors, and of course user frustration. 
        This may include requiring some information or having a pattern.
        Forms can be validated by using keywords in the html however, some older browsers do not support this.
        In order to make it accessible to legacy browsers you would need to do some of this validation in 
        javascript. To do this we use the Constraint Validation API available in most browsers. For some legacy
        browsers you would need to take this a step further and use javascript without the help of the api. In
        the example below we use the validity.valueMissing boolean provided by the api. Using this means we
        have to include required in the html input itself. By telling the form not to validate we ensure only our
        styled validation appears, not the default. We can also setCustomValidity().
    </p>
    <form id='form' novalidate>
        <label for="mail">I Ragnarok, demand you give me words!:</label>
        <input type="email" id="mail" name="mail" required>
        <button>Submit</button>
        <span id="err"></span>
      </form>
      <h1>Fetch options</h1>
      <p>In the Javascript we have a custom header and request. Headers allow us to explain
          what is being requested. We can make the request tell it whether to include
          credentials, use cors, and what method to use among other things. We can then
          create a fetch that uses that information. This may be useful for web workers,
          creating multiple of the same request, or just ensuring our data is accepted where 
          we are trying to send/request the data. To ensure the fetch goes well, we can
          check if response.ok and use feature detection with window.fetch as well as catch errors like typeError. We can guard to
          ensure headers do not get changed.
      </p>
      <span>Here is my post request I created if you look at the javascript (I get the data.name returned):</span>
<script>
const form = document.getElementById("form");
const email = document.getElementById('mail');
const err = document.getElementById('err');

form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
  console.log(email.validity);
  if (email.validity.valueMissing) {
    err.textContent ='fool! Have you no words for this incredible form?';
  } else {
    err.textContent = '';
  }
});
const myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

const data = { 
    name: 'mark',
    job: 'king of the world',
    build: 'top notch'
    };

const myRequest = new Request('https://reqres.in/api/users', {
  method: 'POST', 
  headers: myHeaders,
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});

fetch(myRequest)
    .then(response => {return response.json()})

myDiv.textContent = data.name;
