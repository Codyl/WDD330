    <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <h3>Form Elements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Textarea</li>
        <li>Input - text, button, checkbox, color, radio, etc.</li>
        <li>Select</li>
        <li>Button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Information can be processed on the front-end through Javascript.
        Information processing means traversing forms and data to work with the data.
        The action attribute of the form is where the page sends the data and takes the user to.
        Square bracket notation is better than than using a name attribute or number to access the data.
        ie. <code>const form = document.forms['search'];</code>
        form.submit() can be used to submit the form.
        You can listen for the submit button being pressed with this event listener:
        <code>form.addEventListener ('submit', callback);</code>
        Callback functions get passed an event which can be accessed for its information by putting it in the parameter list.
        You can access parts of the form by its name. ie. form.input1 or form.names[0].
        You can then edit its value like this: form.input1.value="test";
        Buttons work much the same as input of type button. 
    </p>
    <h3>Form Elements</h3>
    <p>Javascript validation involves checks on the form before it is submitted. It does not replace form
        validation on the server side because the user can easily manipulate data on the front-end and cause issues.
        We can write our Javascript validation like so:
        <code>form.addEventListener('submit',validate,false);
        function validate(event) {
            const text = form.elementName1.value;
            if (condition) {
                //preform validation
            }
        }
        </code>
        event.preventDefault() prevents the form from being submitted.
        Provide the user with feedback quickly rather than waiting til submission time and
        the user will be much happier.

    <h2>Object-oriented programming in JS</h2>
    <p> There are three main concepts in OOP:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>encapsulation: hiding how things work from the user</li>
        <li>polymorphism: Allowing various objects to morph their functions to work slightly differently.</li>
        <li>inheritance: Having child classes that can draw from the attributes and methods of its parent class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Class declarations are less error prone than using constructor functions.</p>
    <p>Classes can have static methods that are accessed directly by the class rather than
        the instance of the class. ie. Dice.description()
    </p>
    <p>Every class has a prototype property and a constructor. A prototype property is a live
        property that can be manipulated and change objects data after they have been created.
        ie. className.prototype.propertyName
        The main purpose of the prototype is  'to add any new properties and methods after the class
        has been declared'. In the chrome editor it can be accessed using __proto__ method.
        Like other programming languages you can use the keyword <em>extends</em> to create a child class (inheritance).
        You can override functions like toString to have a more specific use for objects (polymorphism).
    </p>
    <h2>Modern Javascript</h2>
    <h3>Libraries</h3>
    <p>Libraries provide a way to write code faster but adds overhead and may slow down your code.</p>
    <h3>Modules</h3>
    <p>Modules can be added by exporting and importing data. Modules are an alternative to libraries because
        they allow you to create small reusable bits of code rather than including whole libraries.
    </p>
    <h3>MVC</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Model:  functionality for creating, reading,
            updating and deleting</li>
        <li>View: What is rendered to the screen as HTML</li>
        <li>Controller: Reacts to events and communication between the model and view.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Templating Languages</h3>
    <p>Mustache, Pug and Handlebars are Templating languages to name a few. EJS also. EJS
        lets you basically write Javascript logic in a html file without it appearing in a script. 
        It is evaluated before it is shown to the user.
    </p>
    <h3>Package Managers</h3>
    <p>' A package is just a directory with one or more files of
        code, as well as a package.json file that contains information about the code in
        the package.'</p>
        <h4>NPM commands:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>npm install</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Content Delivery Network</h3>
    <p> CDN systems of distributed servers that can
        deliver web resources, such as JavaScript, CSS or image files to a user based on.
    The file will be cached so you can use it again.</p>
    <h3>Deploying Javascript</h3>
    <p>It is optimal to minify your code using one of many tools such as google Closure to add 
        all the nessisary scripts to your html. Transpilers allow you to write in ES6 and have it converted
        to an older version of ES so it can work with older browsers and run faster.
    </p>
    <ol>Here is a list of folders that will help organize files:
        <li>src- Has files to be transpiled</li>
        <li>dist- output of the transpiled code goes into one file and is placed here</li>
        <li>lib - Modules go into this folder</li>
